This repo is site, build according to frontendmentor.io challenge about crownfund site.
CSS part is made, using BEM methodology. 
Sie uses few javascript plugins, one for modal handlign(tinglemodal) and second for rendering progresbar(nanobar.js) 
For rendering changes after selecting one of possible backing option, I have wrote custom state renderer(just an attempt)
